# infraredSwitch

The infrared switch consists of two components, where one program sends a infrared signal (IRRemote.ino) and 
the other program peforms certain actions when a specific signal is recieved (IRReciever.ino). Both of these programs 
utilize the IR Remote Library by Ken Shirriff, which can be installed from the Arduino IDE app. These programs are used
to ensure that, no matter how toys are adapted, the infrared switch will allow a child to use a toy as intended. Programs
will be updated as different methods of adapting toys are found.
